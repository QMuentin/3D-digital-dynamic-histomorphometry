# 3D Digital-dynamic-histomorphometry
MATLAB script that processes binary masks from registered in vivo microCT scans of mouse long bones to enable 3D rendering and quantification of dynamic histomorphometry-like parameters, including mineralizing and eroding surfaces, bone formation rate (BFR), and bone resorption rate (BRR).

Required software (MATLAB R2024b)

Required inputs (registered masks, voxel size, excile file for result export)

How to run (Protocol for 3D digital dynamic histomorphometry of bone via time-lapse registration of serial microCT scans)

Expected outputs (3D rendering of bone formation and resorption, 3D histomorphoometry parameters)
