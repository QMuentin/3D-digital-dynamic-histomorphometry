# 3D Digital-dynamic-histomorphometry
MATLAB script that processes binary masks from registered in vivo microCT scans of mouse long bones to enable 3D rendering and quantification of dynamic histomorphometry-like parameters, including mineralizing and eroding surfaces, bone formation rate (BFR), and bone resorption rate (BRR).
